Frequently asked questions about libinput.

@section faq_fast_mouse My mouse moves too fast, even at the slowest setting

This is a symptom of high-dpi mice (greater than 1000dpi). These devices
need a udev hwdb entry to normalize their motion. See @ref
motion_normalization for a detailed explanation.

@section faq_kinetic_scrolling Kinetic scrolling does not work

The X.Org synaptics driver implemented kinetic scrolling in the driver. It
measures the scroll speed and once the finger leaves the touchpad the driver
keeps sending scroll events for a predetermined time. This effectively
provides for kinetic scrolling without client support but triggers an
unfixable [bug](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38909): the
client cannot know that the events are from a kinetic scroll source. Scroll
events in X are always sent to the current cursor position, a movement of the
cursor after lifting the finger will send the kinetic scroll events to the
new client, something the user does not usually expect. A key event during
the kinetic scroll procedure causes side-effects such as triggering zoom.

libinput does not implement kinetic scrolling for touchpads. Instead it
provides the libinput_event_pointer_get_axis_source() function that enables
callers to implement kinetic scrolling on a per-widget basis, see @ref
scroll_sources.

@section faq_gpl Is libinput GPL-licensed?

No, libinput is MIT licensed. The Linux kernel header file linux/input.h in
libinput's tree is provided to ensure the same behavior regardless of which
kernel version libinput is built on. It does not make libinput GPL-licensed.

@section faq_config_options Where is the configuration stored?

libinput does not store configuration options, it is up to the caller to
manage these and decide which configuration option to apply to each device.
This must be done at startup, after a resume and whenever a new device is
detected.

In a GNOME X.Org stack a user would usually toggle an option in
the gnome-control-center which adjusts a gsettings entry. That change is
picked up by gnome-settings-daemon and applied to the device by adjusting
input device properties that the xf86-input-libinput driver provides.
The input device property changes map to the respective libinput
configuration options.

@dotfile libinput-stack-gnome.gv

This has an effect on the availability of configuration options: if an
option is not exposed by the intermediary, it cannot be configured by the
client. Also some configuration options that are provided by the
intermediary may not be libinput-specific configuration options.
